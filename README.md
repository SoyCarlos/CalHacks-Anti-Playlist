Anti-Playlist is a web app developed by UC Berkeley Students, Youmna Rabie, Carlos Eduardo Ortega, Jaydon Leo Krooss and Yasmine Frigui during UC Berkeley's 2018 CalHacks Hackathon.

Anti-Playlist takes a user's Spotify Playlist URL and uses Glenn McDonald's everynoise.com website to find the "opposite" of as many genres in the playlist using a 12-dimensional analytical space.

To run the app and run app_runner.py. Then open localhost:5000/ in your browser of choice.
